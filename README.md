# LocalCat – Autonomous, Self-Learning Transaction Categorisation System

LocalCat is a fully self-hosted AI/ML engine for categorising raw financial
transactions without relying on third-party APIs. It combines a hybrid transformer +
LightGBM ensemble, per-user personalisation adapters, cold-start semantic fallback,
robust preprocessing, and confidence-driven routing.

This repository contains the full source code for training, evaluating, and
deploying LocalCat, along with a reproducible dockerised environment.
